  "immediate_actions": [
    "Break videos into 5-minute segments for more granular analysis",
    "Implement object detection to count multiple bees per frame",
    "Add species classification for B. vosnesenskii, B. californicus, and B. crotchii",
    "Create synthetic dataset using OpenCV overlays with resizing"
  ],
  "model_improvements": [
    "Upgrade from ResNet-18 to ResNet-50 or VGG16 for better feature extraction",
    "Implement Faster R-CNN for object detection instead of binary classification",
    "Train multi-class classifier for species identification",
    "Add temporal modeling to track bee movements across frames",
    "Reduce false positives (current precision: 0.794)"
  ],
  "data_collection": [
    "Focus on Santa Barbara area bee pictures for species-specific training",
    "Collect more examples of B. californicus (no yellow face/head)",
    "Get examples of B. crotchii (round body, yellow band high on abdomen)",
    "Document bee behavior patterns (on plant vs around plant)"
  ],
  "validation_suggestions": [
    "Review 6 videos with misclassifications",
    "Implement cross-validation with field observations",
    "Create confidence thresholds for different use cases",
    "Validate against manual bee counts in sample videos",
    "Test model performance across different weather conditions"
